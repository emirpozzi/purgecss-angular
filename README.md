# Purge CSS CLI for Angular
Remove unused CSS and Sass classes in your stylesheets.
This is a simple python script that goes through all stylesheets in a project, finds CSS classes and verifies if they are used in the respective component .ts file.

The CLI outputs a list of the unused CSS classes and it does not modify anyfile.
